**Planning File**

Main ideas: 
- Takes in recipe measurements and converts them to a certain proportion
- Stores recipes in a database
- You can provide a list of ingredients you have and it searchs database for recipes you can make
- Will also convert ingredients like cups to grams

**Recipe Converter Application - Phase 1: Planning & Setup**

**1. Project Overview**

Project Name: Recipe Wizard

              As well as save and store recipes that are commonly used. It also allows for a user to enter the ingredients they have and provides a recipe
              that would be possible to make with those. 

Target Users: Bakers/Cooks

Key Features:

  - Convert ingredient measurements (e.g., cups to grams, Fahrenheit to Celsius)
